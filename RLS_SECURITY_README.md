# RLS Security Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

Your TwoFactorAuth application now has **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled, providing database-level access control. Here's what's been added:

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### 1. **Session-Based Authentication**
- Secure random session tokens (256-bit entropy)
- 24-hour session expiry with automatic refresh
- Session tokens required for all database operations
- Multiple device support (concurrent sessions)

### 2. **Row Level Security Policies**
All three tables now have RLS enabled with strict policies:

#### **Users Table**
- ✅ Can only view your own profile
- ✅ Can only update your own password
- ✅ Public registration allowed (for signup)
- ❌ Cannot delete users (protected)

#### **Auths Table (2FA Entries)**
- ✅ Can only see your own 2FA accounts
- ✅ Can only add 2FA for yourself
- ✅ Can only modify your own entries
- ✅ Can only delete your own entries

#### **Sessions Table**
- ✅ Can view your own active sessions
- ✅ Can logout (delete sessions)
- ✅ Automatic expiry cleanup

## 📁 New Files Created

1. **`/supabase/migrations/002_add_sessions_table.sql`**
   - Creates sessions table and helper functions
   - Implements session validation logic

2. **`/supabase/migrations/003_enable_rls_policies.sql`**
   - Enables RLS on all tables
   - Creates security policies
   - Includes both header-based and context-based approaches

3. **Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Session token generation
   - Session management in database
   - Automatic session refresh
   - Secure logout with session cleanup

4. **Updated `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`**
   - Automatic session token headers
   - Helper function for RPC calls with session context

5. **Updated `SETUP_SUPABASE.md`**
   - Complete security documentation
   - Migration instructions
   - Testing procedures

## 🚀 How to Deploy These Changes

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run migrations in order:
   - `001_initial_setup.sql` (if not already done)
   - `002_add_sessions_table.sql`
   - `003_enable_rls_policies.sql`

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Create a new account or login
- Verify session token in localStorage
- Check that 2FA entries work correctly

### Step 3: Verify Security
In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- Should return all true for rowsecurity
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('users', 'auths', 'sessions');
```

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

### Before (Without RLS)
- ❌ Anyone with your anon key could read/write all data
- ❌ Security only enforced in frontend (easily bypassed)
- ❌ No audit trail of access

### After (With RLS)
- ✅ Database enforces user isolation
- ✅ Session tokens required for access
- ✅ Expired sessions automatically rejected
- ✅ Audit trail via sessions table
- ✅ Multiple layers of security

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Domain Restriction Limitation
While RLS provides excellent user isolation, it **cannot directly restrict by domain/origin**. To achieve domain-specific access:

1. **Use CORS policies** on your hosting provider
2. **Keep API keys private** (never commit to Git)
3. **Implement rate limiting** at hosting level
4. **Use HTTPS only** in production
5. **Add security headers** to your web server

### Additional Security Measures
- Session tokens are cryptographically secure (256-bit)
- Passwords use bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Automatic session refresh every 30 minutes
- Proper logout cleans up sessions

## 📊 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run all three migrations in order
- [ ] Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
- [ ] Test user registration (signup)
- [ ] Test user login
- [ ] Verify session token in localStorage
- [ ] Test adding 2FA entries
- [ ] Test viewing only your own 2FA entries
- [ ] Test logout (session cleanup)
- [ ] Verify old sessions expire after 24 hours

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Ensure RLS policies are created
   - Check session token is present
   - Verify session hasn't expired

2. **Cannot see 2FA entries**
   - Session might be expired
   - Try logging out and back in

3. **Login works but operations fail**
   - RLS policies might not be properly created
   - Re-run migration 003

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production**
2. **Configure CORS** on your hosting provider
3. **Set up monitoring** for the sessions table
4. **Implement session cleanup cron job**
5. **Consider adding 2FA for admin accounts**

## 🤝 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify migrations ran successfully
3. Check Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
4. Review the SETUP_SUPABASE.md for detailed instructions

Your database is now significantly more secure with proper user isolation and session management!
